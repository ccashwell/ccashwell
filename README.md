### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software **engineer**, **security analyst** and **technical consultant** with a proven track record of leading distributed teams to design, develop and launch products that win. For most of the last decade I've been deeply focused on machine learning and distributed ledger technologies. I like hard problems and taking chances.

I've built all sorts of software in several languages, including foundational contributions to popular blockchains and peer-to-peer protocols, financial analytics, algorithmic trading systems, web and mobile apps, distributed systems and microservices that power core banking systems. I've also been an active contributor to a few open-source projects and dev tools that are used by millions of developers around the world. My research and development work has contributed to innovations in diverse spaces ranging from solar energy to econometrics, and it has helped secure numerous US government contracts and grant awards, as well as over $400 million in private capital. 

When Iâ€™m not hacking on something Iâ€™m excited about, Iâ€™m either traveling or busy on my farm trying to reinvent the egg and/or myself.

TLDR: I'm a curious creator with hands-on experience both building and leading teams of builders to ship all sorts of software designed to address a wide variety of real-world problems (and no shortage of fun stuff, too). I have a strong background in security and privacy, and I enjoy finding flaws in systems and building future-proof solutions where possible. I'm very pro-crypto, but I'm a sucker for traditional equities and options trading strategies. I'm big on decentralization, AI and fixing things that feel broken to me. 

Primary areas of focus: `machine learning`, `blockchain`, `digital ledger technology`, `cryptocurrency`, `information security`, `threat analysis`, `risk modeling`, `algorithmic asset management`, `technical analysis`.
