### Hey, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software **engineer**, **security analyst** and **technical consultant** with a proven track record of leading distributed teams to design, develop and launch products that win. For most of the last decade I've been deeply focused on machine learning and distributed ledger technologies.

I've built all sorts of software in several languages, including foundational contributions to popular blockchains and peer-to-peer protocols, financial analytics tools, algorithmic trading systems, web and mobile apps, massively distributed services, and core banking systems that directly power many of the worldâ€™s leading fintech companies. My research and development work has contributed to innovations in diverse fields ranging from solar energy to econometrics, and Iâ€™ve helped secure numerous US government contracts and grant awards, as well as over $400 million in private capital. For the past decade, my energy has been almost exclusively focused on distributed systems and protocol design.

I'm an insatiably curious, crypto-native creator, and I like to ship stuff that matters. Iâ€™m deeply committed to disintermediation, self-sovereignty, incentive alignment, and spearheading outrageously ambitious initiatives. I spend a lot of time thinking about stuff like decentralization, democratization, machine learning, and just how fragile most of the systems society relies on really are. When Iâ€™m not hacking on something Iâ€™m excited about, Iâ€™m probably on the farm working with my horses or trying to wrangle something.

Teamwork makes the dream work ðŸ’«
