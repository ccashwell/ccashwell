### Hey, I'm Chris. Strangers on the internet call me [@poppa](https://t.me/poppa).

#### I'm a _full-stack software engineer_, _security analyst_ and _technical consultant_ with a proven track record of leading distributed teams to design, develop and launch products that win in every way that counts.

I've built all sorts of software in several languages, including foundational contributions to popular blockchains and peer-to-peer protocols, financial analytics tools, algorithmic trading systems, web and mobile apps, massively distributed services, and core banking systems that directly power many of the world’s leading fintech companies. My research and development work has contributed to innovations in diverse fields ranging from solar energy to econometrics, and I've helped secure numerous US government contracts and grant awards, as well as over $400 million in private capital. For the past decade, my energy has been almost exclusively focused on distributed systems and protocol design. 

These days I'm directing my energy toward cross-chain primitives, like [@uniswap/the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact). Before this, I led protocol development for [TITLES](https://titles.xyz) and [Boost](https://boost.xyz), and in the web3 space more broadly I've contributed to ~2 dozen projects with nearly $10 billion in TVL across a range of blockchain architectures including Bitcoin, EVM, Solana and TON.

I'm an insatiably curious, crypto-native creator, and I like to ship stuff that matters. I'm deeply committed to security, disintermediation, self-sovereignty, incentive alignment, and spearheading outrageously ambitious initiatives. I spend a lot of time thinking about stuff like decentralization, democratization, machine learning, and just how fragile most of the systems society relies on really are. When I'm not hacking on something I'm excited about, I can probably be found on the farm working with my horses or trying to wrangle something.

Teamwork makes the dream work 💫
